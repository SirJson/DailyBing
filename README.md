# DailyBing

This simple .NET Core 3.0 application will update your Windows desktop with the daily picture from Bing.com.

Just run DailyBing.exe or put a shortcut into your Startup folder. Better yet build this project yourself and create a framework dependend version to shrink down the executable size.
